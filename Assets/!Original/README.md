TODO:


turn rocks into gameobjects with static batching (since details dont support LOD, and they disappear at a distance)
convert spline system into Splines Package for consistency and stability
Add flowmap to river shader
add gpu instanced grass (BOTW, acerola)
add clouds, sun, moon to skybox shader

GET INSPIRED BY THE MUSIC (create a new ableton project and create something cool without the bloat)
